  "longDescription": "System tray app to control Asus G14 laptop, more specifically this was to add a new AniMe matrix function to show dynamic weather and time of day. This pulls data from openweathermap to provide dynamic cloud generation, rain, snow, wind, and a sun/moon cycle depending on sunrise/sunset. This was recently featured on an ASUS podcast (my username when releasing this was Idzuna)",
