  "shortDescription": "Tool for deserializing protobuf kafka records",
  "longDescription": "Quick solution to viewing protobuf serialized kafka records. A Python script reads messages from a topic (with partition and offset optional) and programmatically deserializes the message when given a folder of available proto files. This was made because there was a need to read kafka messages in production for debugging purposes while implementing a schema registry was under way.",
